Note: Make sure the badge is oriented the correct way before connecting to power. It is easy to plug in upside down since all the sides look the same.

1. Solder 2 LEDs on each of the 4 frame boards with the cathode ends away from the middle, indicated by small dots.
1. Solder the 8 resistors on the back of the main board.
1. Solder the headers on the main badge.
1. Trim the excess header length on the front of the board. This allows the mirror to be flat against the board.
1. Put the frame boards into the jig with the corners interlocked, the LEDs toward the center, and the 3 solder pads facing up.
1. Put mirror in the middle of the jig facing down. You may want to clean it off first since it will be more difficult to clean when the badge is assembled.
1. Put super glue on the 4 corners of the frame and on the back of the mirror. Then put the main board against the mirror with the resistors facing outward. As long as the resistors are on the outside, the orientation doesn't matter.
1. Solder each frame side to the back by soldering the 3 pads for each board. At this point you might want to test out the board to make sure the LEDs turn on.
1. Cut the mirror film to the size of the piece of acrylic. Then trim an additional .5 - 1 mm from the height and width. We want the film to be slightly smaller than the acrylic.
1. Peel the brown paper from one side of the acrylic and apply the mirror film to it. The film has a backing that needs to be peeled off as well. There should be a marker line on the side to peel off. To apply the mirror film, put a small amount of non-ammonia window cleaner on the acrylic and then apply the film while trying to remove all bubbles. It is okay if the film doesn't go all the way to the edges since the frame should cover it.
1. Peel the other side of the acrylic place it in the badge resting on the LEDs. It should fit inside the 4 pcb frame pieces.
1. Use a blade and file/sandpaper to clean any parts of the 3d-printed frame that need to be cleaned up.
