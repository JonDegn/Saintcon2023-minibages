## Build guide

(video)

1. Solder 2 LEDs on each of the 4 frame boards with the cathode ends away from the middle, indicated by small dots.
1. Solder the 8 resistors on the back of the main board.
1. Solder the headers on the main badge.
1. Trim the excess header length on the front of the board. This allows the mirror to be flat against the board.
1. Put the frame boards into the jig with the corners interlocked, the resistors toward the center, and the 3 solder pads facing up.
1. Put mirror in the middle of the jig facing down. You may want to clean it off first since it will be more difficult to clean when the badge is assembled.
1. Put super glue on the 4 corners of the frame and on the back of the mirror. Then put the main board against the mirror with the resistors facing outward. As long as the resistors are on the outside, the orientation doesn't matter.
1. Solder each frame side to the back by soldering the 3 pads for each board.
